**"DESCRIPTION."**

The functions in the printf() family produce output according to a format as described below. The functions printf() and vprintf() write output to stdout, the standard output stream; fprintf() and vfprintf() write output to the given output stream; sprintf(), snprintf(), vsprintf(), and vsnprintf() write to the character string str.

The function dprintf() is the same as fprintf() except that it outputs to a file descriptor, fd, instead of to a stdio stream.

The functions snprintf() and vsnprintf() write at most size bytes (including the terminating null byte ('\0')) to str.

The functions vprintf(), vfprintf(), vdprintf(), vsprintf(), vsnprintf() are equivalent to the functions printf(), fprintf(), dprintf(), sprintf(), snprintf(), respectively, except that they are called with a va_list instead of a variable number of arguments. These functions do not call the va_end macro. Because they invoke the va_arg macro, the value of ap is undefined after the call. See stdarg(3).

All of these functions write the output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg(3)) are converted for output.

**Format of the format string.**

The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier. In between there may be (in this order) zero or more flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional precision and an optional length modifier.

Conversion specifiers.

A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are: ###**%**
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.

**d, i**

The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation. The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros. The default precision is 1. When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.

**c**

If no l modifier is present, the int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written. If an l modifier is present, the wint_t (wide character) argument is converted to a multibyte sequence by a call to the wcrtomb(3) function, with a conversion state starting in the initial state, and the resulting multibyte string is written.

**s**

If no l modifier is present: the const char \* argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0'); if a precision is specified, no more than the number specified are written. If a precision is given, no null byte need be present; if the precision is not specified, or is greater than the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating null byte.

If an l modifier is present: the const wchar_t \* argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of wide characters. Wide characters from the array are converted to multibyte characters (each by a call to the wcrtomb(3) function, with a conversion state starting in the initial state before the first wide character), up to and including a terminating null wide character. The resulting multibyte characters are written up to (but not including) the terminating null byte. If a precision is specified, no more bytes than the number specified are written, but no partial multibyte characters are written. Note that the precision determines the number of bytes written, not the number of wide characters or screen positions. The array must contain a terminating null wide character, unless a precision is given and it is so small that the number of bytes written exceeds it before the end of the array is reached.

**Return value.**

Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

The functions snprintf() and vsnprintf() do not write more than size bytes (including the terminating null byte ('\0')). If the output was truncated due to this limit, then the return value is the number of characters (excluding the terminating null byte) which would have been written to the final string if enough space had been available. Thus, a return value of size or more means that the output was truncated. (See also below under NOTES.)

If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
