**Requirements**

_Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

_All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

_All your files should end with a new line

_A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

_Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

_You are not allowed to use global variables

_No more than 5 functions per file

_You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden

_You are allowed to use _putchar

_You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

_In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

_The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called holberton.h

_Don’t forget to push your header file.

**0-holberton.c**

Write a program that prints Holberton, followed by a new line.

_The program should return 0.

**1-alphabet.c**

Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

_Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);

_You can only use _putchar twice in your code

**2-print_alphabet_x10.c**

Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

_Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);

_You can only use _putchar twice in your code

**3-islower.c**

Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

_Prototype: int _islower(int c);

_Returns 1 if c is lowercase

_Returns 0 otherwise

**4-isalpha.c**

Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.

_Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);

_Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase

_Returns 0 otherwise

**5-sign.c**

Write a function that prints the sign of a number.

_Prototype: int print_sign(int n);

_Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero

_Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero

_Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

**6-abs.c**

Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

_Prototype: int _abs(int);

**7-print_last_digit.c**

Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

_Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);

_Returns the value of the last digit

**8-24_hours.c**

Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

_Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);

_You can listen to this soundtrack while coding :)

**9-times_table.c**

Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

_Prototype: void times_table(void);

_Format: see example

**10-add.c**

Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

_Prototype: int add(int, int);

**11-print_to_98.c**

Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

_Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);

_Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space

_Numbers should be printed in order

_The first printed number should be the number passed to your function

_The last printed number should be 98

_You are allowed to use the standard library
